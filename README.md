# SubDictioanary
Academic project

Instructions:

In part 1, I wrote a program that will accept a text file as input and creates a sub-dictionary that includes most of the words found in the input file based on a number of specific rules.

In part 2, I wrote a program, using my own-built linked list, that manipulates a set of records of cell phones
and performs some operations on these records.
